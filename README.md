<h2>Feel free to have a look at my Data Science projects</h2> 
</div>

After working in the automotive sector and the internet industry in multinationals as in startup, Iâ€™ve decided to start a new professional chapter and have successfully completed **the bootcamp of Data science** from The bridge.  
<br>

**Data Analysis** is my personal favorite discipline and I look forward to put into practice the skills I have learned and to share the experience I have gained along the companies Iâ€™ve worked for.
